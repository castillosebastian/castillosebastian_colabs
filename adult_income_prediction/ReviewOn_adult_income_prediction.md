# The discusion

The pervasive application of machine learning in various industries, coupled with its significant societal impact, has heightened concerns about the fairness and ethical underpinnings of these technologies. More importantly, experiments that unveil biases and disparities inherent in these implementations have .dismantled the idea of algorithmic 'neutrality', emphasizes the critical need for alignment with laws and values pertaining to human dignity.

Ethical concepts involved in this discussion:

- fairness,
- transparency,
- accauntability,
- trust

In this setting, the concept of **responsible AI** has arisen as a vital component of every AI project. A key goal in this regard is to develop tools that can facilitate the creation of fair and ethically grounded innovations. In the subsequent sections, we will explore some of these tools, assessing their strengths and weaknesses.
